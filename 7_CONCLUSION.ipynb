    "Depending on the climate zone, heating and/or cooling can account for 20% to 50% of energy used in Australian homes.\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use machine larning models to generate a nuanced energy demand forecast using hourly weather data to predict large spikes in electricity demand. \n"
